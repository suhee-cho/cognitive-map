# Patch-Closed Manifolds and Off-Manifold Interventions

This repository contains the code and theoretical results for our study on **patch-closed manifolds**, **coordinate-wise interventions**, and the characterization of convex sets that remain stable under such interventions. We show that **axis-aligned hyperrectangles** are the *only* convex manifolds that are closed under arbitrary coordinate patching, and we connect these results to representation-level interventions used in modern interpretability workflows.
